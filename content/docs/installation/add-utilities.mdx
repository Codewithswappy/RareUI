RareUI components rely on a few common utility functions. If you used the `init` command, these are likely already set up.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Install dependencies

We use `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for conditional class merging.

```bash
npm install clsx tailwind-merge
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Create utility file

Create a file at `lib/utils.ts` (or your preferred location) and add the following code:

```ts title="lib/utils.ts"
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Animation Dependencies

RareUI uses `framer-motion` (or `motion`) for animations.

### Next.js 15 / React 19 Note

If you are using the latest React 19, you may need to override the peer dependency versions until `framer-motion` is fully updated, or switch to the new `motion` package.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "overrides": {
    "framer-motion": {
      "react": "19.0.0-rc",
      "react-dom": "19.0.0-rc"
    }
  }
}
```
