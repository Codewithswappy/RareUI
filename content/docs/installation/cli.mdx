The RareUI CLI is the fastest way to add components to your project. It handles dependencies, configuration, and placement for you.

## Init

Run the `init` command to initialize RareUI in your project. This will create a `components.json` file and configure your project for the best experience.

```bash
npx rareui init
```

## Add

Use the `add` command to add components to your project. This command downloads the component code and places it in your `components` directory, installing any necessary dependencies automatically.

```bash
npx rareui add [component]
```

### Examples

Add a single component (supports both PascalCase and kebab-case):

```bash
npx rareui add particle-card
npx rareui add LiquidButton
```

Add multiple components at once:

```bash
npx rareui add particle-card liquid-button soft-button
```

Install all available components:

```bash
npx rareui add .
```

View the list of available components:

```bash
npx rareui add
```

## Diff

Check for updates to your installed components and update them if needed.

```bash
npx rareui diff
```

### Examples

Check all installed components for updates:

```bash
npx rareui diff
```

Check a specific component:

```bash
npx rareui diff liquid-button
```

Update without confirmation:

```bash
npx rareui diff -y
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Does it work with other frameworks?</summary>

Currently, the CLI is optimized for Next.js and React projects using Tailwind CSS. Support for other frameworks is planned.

<details>
<summary>Can I use it without the CLI?</summary>

Yes! You can manually copy and paste the code from the documentation into your project. The CLI just automates this process.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use both kebab-case and PascalCase for component names?</summary>

Yes! The CLI supports both formats:
- `npx rareui add liquid-button` (kebab-case)

Both will install the same component. Use whichever format you prefer!
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I know if my components need updates?</summary>

Run the `diff` command to check for updates:

```bash
npx rareui diff
```

This will show you which components have updates available and what changed.

- Cards: `components/rareui/cards/`
- Loaders: `components/rareui/loaders/`
</details>
