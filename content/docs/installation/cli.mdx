The RareUI CLI is the fastest way to add components to your project. It handles dependencies, configuration, and placement for you.

## Init

Run the `init` command to initialize RareUI in your project. This will create a `components.json` file and configure your project for the best experience.

```bash
npx rareui init
```

## Add

Use the `add` command to add components to your project. This command downloads the component code and places it in your `components` directory, installing any necessary dependencies automatically.

```bash
npx rareui add [component]
```

### Examples

Add a single component:

```bash
npx rareui add particle-card
```

Add multiple components at once:

```bash
npx rareui add particle-card liquid-button
```

View the list of available components:

```bash
npx rareui add
```
