title: Install Next.js
description: Create a new Next.js app and run it locally.
---

## Quick start

1. Create a new Next.js app named `my-app`
2. `cd my-app` and start the dev server
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --yes
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

`--yes` skips prompts using saved preferences or defaults. The default setup enables TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, App Router, and Turbopack, with import alias `@/*`.

---

## System requirements

Before you begin, make sure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- Minimum Node.js version: 20.9
- Operating systems: macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux

---

## Supported browsers

Next.js supports modern browsers with zero configuration:

- Chrome 111+
- Edge 111+
- Firefox 111+
- Safari 16.4+

---

## Create with the CLI

The quickest way to create a new Next.js app is using `create-next-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```txt
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use the recommended Next.js defaults?
    Yes, use recommended defaults - TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, App Router, Turbopack
    No, reuse previous settings
    No, customize settings - Choose your own preferences
```

If you choose to `customize settings`, you'll see the following prompts:

```txt
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Which linter would you like to use? ESLint / Biome / None
Would you like to use React Compiler? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

After the prompts, `create-next-app` will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

---

## Manual installation

To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

```bash
npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

Then, add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "eslint",
    "lint:fix": "eslint --fix"
  }
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `next dev`: Starts the development server using Turbopack (default bundler)
- `next build`: Builds the application for production
- `next start`: Starts the production server
- `eslint`: Runs ESLint

### Create the `app` directory

Next.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.

Create an `app` folder. Then, inside `app`, create a `layout.tsx` file. This file is the root layout. It's required and must contain the `<html>` and `<body>` tags.

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Create a home page `app/page.tsx` with some initial content:

```tsx
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```

Both `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (`/`).

> **Good to know**: If you forget to create the root layout, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with `next dev`.

### Create the `public` folder (optional)

Create a `public` folder at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export default function Page() {
  return <Image src="/profile.png" alt="Profile" width={100} height={100} />
}
```

---

## Run the development server

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application
3. Edit the `app/page.tsx` file and save it to see the updated result in your browser

---

## Set up TypeScript

> Minimum TypeScript version: `v5.1.0`

Next.js comes with built-in TypeScript support. To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to `.ts` / `.tsx` and run `next dev`. Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a `tsconfig.json` file with the recommended config options.

### IDE Plugin

Next.js includes a custom TypeScript plugin and type checker, which VSCode and other code editors can use for advanced type-checking and auto-completion.

You can enable the plugin in VS Code by:

1. Opening the command palette (`Ctrl/⌘` + `Shift` + `P`)
2. Searching for "TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version"
3. Selecting "Use Workspace Version"

---

## Set up Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases

Next.js has in-built support for the `"paths"` and `"baseUrl"` options of `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json` files.

These options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier and cleaner to import modules. For example:

```jsx
// Before
import { Button } from '../../../components/button'

// After
import { Button } from '@/components/button'
```

To configure absolute imports, add the `baseUrl` configuration option to your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src/"
  }
}
```

In addition to configuring the `baseUrl` path, you can use the `"paths"` option to "alias" module paths.

For example, the following configuration maps `@/components/*` to `components/*`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src/",
    "paths": {
      "@/styles/*": ["styles/*"],
      "@/components/*": ["components/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Each of the `"paths"` are relative to the `baseUrl` location.
