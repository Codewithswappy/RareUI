## Why Choose RareUI?

### 🎨 **Premium Designs**
Every component features modern, professional designs that stand out. No more generic-looking UIs.

### 🌙 **Dark Mode Native**
All components support dark mode out of the box using CSS variables.

### 🎯 **Production Ready**

### 🔧 **Fully Customizable**
Components are installed as source code in your project, so you have complete control to customize them.

## Philosophy

RareUI is built on three core principles:

1. **Developer Experience First** - Commands are simple, docs are clear, and components work out of the box.
2. **Design Excellence** - Every component should look premium and feel polished.
3. **Zero Lock-in** - Code lives in your project. Modify, extend, or remove components as needed.

## What Makes RareUI Different?

- ✅ **No npm package to install** - Copy-paste the exact code you need
- ✅ **No version conflicts** - Your code, your control
